# Battleship Game Overview

## Project Structure

This Battleship game project is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific role in the functionality of the game. Below is a breakdown of the key components of the project.

### Root Directory

- **main.py**: The entry point of the game. This file contains the main logic to start and run the game. It initializes the game, displays the menu, and handles game flow.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project, including any libraries for handling the game's interface, sound, or other utilities.
- **LICENSE**: Contains the license details under which this project is distributed.
- **README.md**: General information about the project and its setup.

### `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`
- **.gitattributes**: Configuration file specifying attributes for version control behavior.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git to keep the repository clean (e.g., virtual environment files or compiled Python bytecode).

### `src/` (Source Code)
The core game logic is contained within this folder. It is subdivided into several modules:

- **`audio.py`**: Handles the playback of audio files such as background music, sound effects for hits, misses, and sinking ships.
- **`board.py`**: Defines the game board and its interactions, such as placing ships, tracking hits, and updating cell states.
- **`cell.py`**: Contains the logic for individual cells on the game board, handling whether they contain a ship and whether they have been hit.
- **`config.py`**: Stores configuration settings, constants, or parameters used across the game.
- **`display.py`**: Manages the game's graphical display, including rendering the board and player interactions.
- **`game.py`**: Implements the core gameplay loop, including player turns, ship placement, and determining the game's end.
- **`ship.py`**: Contains the logic for ship objects, including their size, position on the board, and their state (hit or sunk).
- **`types.py`**: Defines custom types and data structures used throughout the game for better code organization.

#### `screens/`
This folder manages different game screens such as menus, in-game transitions, and the game-over screen.

- **`_screen.py`**: A base screen class that other screens inherit from.
- **`menu.py`**: Displays the main menu where players can start a new game or quit.
- **`finish.py`**: Manages the display when a player wins or loses.
- **`playing.py`**: Contains the logic for the actual gameplay screen, handling player inputs and displaying the game state.
- **`selection.py`**: Manages the ship selection screen where players place their ships.
- **`turn_transition.py`**: Displays a transition screen between turns.

### `sound/`
This folder contains sound effects and music that enhance the game experience.

- **background.mp3**: The background music that plays during the game.
- **hit.mp3**: A sound effect that plays when a ship is hit.
- **miss.mp3**: A sound effect that plays when a player misses a shot.
- **sink.mp3**: A sound effect that plays when a ship is sunk.
- **how_to_play.txt**: A text file that provides instructions for playing the game.

### `documentation/`
Contains additional documentation related to the project.

- **hours.md**: A file documenting the time spent or hours logged working on the project.

## Running the Game

To run the game, make sure you have Python installed. First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the game using:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Additional Notes

- The game supports sound effects and music, so ensure your sound system is configured properly to enjoy the full experience.
- The game logic is split across various modules to ensure that each component (board, ships, audio, etc.) is well encapsulated and manageable.
